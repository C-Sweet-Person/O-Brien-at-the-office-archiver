# O-Brien-at-the-office-archiver
Gives you all of the images of the "Chief O'Brien at the office" webcomic

Make sure that BS4, requests and urllib.request are installed to your python file.
This python file creates an image folder and populates it with all of the comic images from the webcomic.
Note: Issue 89 is just called "KickstarterComic" as with another one. Will have to be renamed in your collection.
